## What We Do

We represent the grad students in the department, and have regular social and mentoring [events](events). 
We assist with the annual open house for prospective students, 
run each year's office draw, 
and organize the peer mentor program between graduate students.

We also sell Berkeley Math [T-shirts and mugs](gear).

The MGSA is led by a group of elected officers, serving for terms of one year.
