Each available office is highlighted and marked with its capacity and whether it has a window and/or balcony. The other rooms are not graduate student offices.

## Office Draw Rules

The office draw is held at the end of each Spring semester. The three options for entering the office draw are:

1. **Blocking**: Blocking with other graduate students allows you to pick your office at the same time as them. It does not guarantee that there will be an office that will fit your entire blocking group, nor does it require you to all go in a single office if there is one available.
2. **Floating:** If you do not block, and instead enter the office draw individually, then you are treated as a block of size 1. At the office draw, you may pick any office which has an open spot.
3. **Squatting:** Squatting means that you wish to remain in your current office. In order to be eligible to squat, the average priority of those who wish to remain in the office cannot have not increased since when they entered the office (see below for the precise details).

The picking order and office selection times will be emailed out ahead of the office draw.

Unless you are squatting, you will choose your new office on the day of the office draw at your designated time. If you cannot make that time, send a surrogate or [contact us](/contact) with your preferences.

## Priorities

Each graduate student has an individual priority, which is determined by their year in the department for the year they will occupy the office (lower numbers are better):


{{< table largetable >}}
<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right;">Year:</td><td>1st</td><td>2nd</td><td>3rd</td><td>4th</td><td>5th</td><td>6th</td><td>7th</td><td>8th+</td></tr>
<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:left;">Individual Priority:</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr>
{{< /table >}}

1st years have their own office draw during orientation, in which they may block with each other. The year of a transfer student for purposes of the office draw will be based on how far along they are with their studies.

There are a few other factors which modify individual priorities:

* Full-year MGSA officers start with an individual priority of 0.
* Half-year MGSA officers start with their individual priority decreased by half.
* Up to 5 NRing organizers have their individual priority decreased by 1.
* Up to 5 URep organizers have their individual priority decreased by 1.
* GA Delegates have their individual priority decreased by 1.
* The winner of the Halloween costume contest has their individual priority decreased by 1. If the winning submission involves n≤5 people then each person gets their individual priority decreased by 1. In the unlikely event that the winning submission involves n>5 people, the group must choose how to apportion a priority deduction of 5.

The priority of a block is the average of the individual priorities of its members. Blocks that are tied with the same priority are randomly ordered.

Details of the squatting condition: In order to squat, you must have p ≤ q, where 

* p is the average of the individual priorities of everyone who will be remaining in the office.
* q is the average of the effective priorities of the everyone who will be remaining in the office.
* Your effective priority is the priority of your block from the most recent year in which you did not squat.

**Example:** Last office draw, third years Alice and Bob were in a four-person blocking group with two second years. This block had priority (3 + 3 + 4 + 4)/4 = 3.5. This group had to split up during office selection because there were no four-person offices left. Alice and Bob end up with sixth year Chuck, and become friends. The three of them want to squat in the next office draw. Their average priority will be p = (2 + 2 + 3)/3 = 2.33. Their average effective priority will be q = (3.5 + 3.5 + 1)/3 = 2.67. The group is allowed to squat, since 2.33 ≤ 2.67.

## Moving Day

There is a single moving day at the beginning of the fall semester. It is usually the first day of classes, but there are exceptions. If you are unable to move on this day, you have three options:

1. Ask a friend to move your belongings for you on moving day.
2. Talk to the current occupants of your future office and try to arrange a time prior to moving day when you can move your belongings.
3. Pack your belongings in boxes and put them in a corner of your current office so they take up minimal space. Talk to the future occupants and arrange a time to pick up your belongings after moving day.

*Note:* This should only be done if you will be able to pick up your belongings within two weeks.

This list may change year on year -- the department occasionally reallocates offices, changing which ones are for graduate students, which ones are for faculty, which ones are for visitors, and so on.
